## Summaries of Data

This document contains summary information regarding the HVTN065 treatment data.

There are 120 patients:

* 100 patients in treatment group
* 20 patients in placebo group

This is a snapshot of `data.frame` of treatment data we have.

```{r treatment_head}
head(treatment.HVTN065)
```

The columns `viral_vector` and `POX` are the same.

```{r viral_equals_POX}
with(treatment.HVTN065, all(viral_vector == POX))
```

The columns `POX` and `Control` are mutually exclusive. That is, the `POX` column indicates the **Treatment** group, while the `Control` column indicates the **Placebo** group.

```{r POX_Control_exclusive}
with(treatment.HVTN065, all(xor(POX, Control)))
```

## Treatment Groups

Next, we examine the counts of patients assigned to both dosage groups.

```{r table_dosages}
with(treatment.HVTN065, table(product1_dose, product2_dose))
```

There appear to be 4 groups.

1. 20 patient who receive a placebo before and after (these are the **Placebo** patients)
2. 30 patients who were given a placebo first but then `10^8 TCID50` (**not** placebo patients)
3. 10 patients who received `0.3 mg` followed by `10^7 TCID50`
4. 60 patients who received `3 mg` followed by `10^8 TCID50`

To confirm that the 20 placebo patients are as mentioned in point 1:

```{r placebo_patients}
with(treatment.HVTN065, sum(product1_dose == "0 mg" & product2_dose == "0 TCID50" & Control == 1))
```

At first, it appears that the 4 groups mentioned above might be designated in the `group` column. However, this is not the case:

```{r table_dosage_group}
with(treatment.HVTN065, table(product1_dose, product2_dose, group))
```

Within each group, there are a small number of placebo patients and a larger number of patients receiving a dosage. But if we look at `group` versus `arm`, we see the same story:

```{r group_arm}
with(treatment.HVTN065, table(group, arm))
```

Clearly, within the `arm` column, **P** is short for **Placebo**, and **T** is short for **Treatment**.

The following quote on page 611 of Goepfert et al. describes the dosages by group. Below, the excerpt is separated by the individual groups:

### Group 1

> The study was designed with 10 participants receiving .3 mg of the JS7 (D) and 107 tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of MVA62 (1/10th dose [M]) at 8-week intervals in the DDMM schedule.

### Group 2

> After a safety review of the 1/10th-dose DNA vaccinations, 30 participants were randomized to receive full doses of the vaccines (3 mg and 108 TCID50, respectively) in the DDMM sequence.

### Group 3

> Once the full-dose DDMM regimen was demonstrated to be adequately safe and immunogenic, part B of the trial was started. This included the enrollment of 30 participants to receive full-dose vaccines in the DMM... 

### Group 4

> ...or MMM sequences with immunizations administered at 0, 8, and 24 weeks.

### Placebo Randomization

> The placebo product used for all groups was saline, and placebo participants were enrolled at a ratio of placebo recipients to vaccines of 1:5.

Below, a screenshot of Figure 1B in Goepfert et al. summarizes the above excerpts and confirms the group numbers above.

Now that the group dosage information is understood, we should have an easier time incorporating the information into predicting T-cell and antibody response.

## Miscellaneous Information

The following columns can be safely removed because they either are redundant or offer no information:

* `protocol`
* `grp`
* `rx_code`
* `rx_flag`
* `rx_flag_com`
* `route`

The two group columns, `group` and `grp`, both provide the same information:

```{r group_grp}
with(treatment.HVTN065, table(group, grp))
```

The `rx_code` column is a bit redundant...

```{r rx_code}
with(treatment.HVTN065, table(arm, rx_code))
```
